Host Environment is a [universal JavaScript](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) library that makes it easy to detect what host environment your code is running in.  It lets you answer questions like:

- Am I running in Node.js or a web browser?
- Is this Node 8.x or newer?
- Are we in Internet Explorer?
- Is this a Windows computer?

Maybe some parts of your app are only available in Node and not in web browsers.  Or maybe you need to determine whether to load a [polyfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)) library.  Or maybe you need to [conditionally run tests](https://jsdevtools.org/karma-host-environment/) in different environments.  Whatever your reason, Host Environment can help.



Example
--------------------------

```javascript
import host from "host-environment";

if (host.browser) {
  // Browser logic here

  if (host.browser.IE) {
    // Load a polyfill for Internet Explorer
  }
}

if (host.node) {
  // Node.js logic here

  if (host.node.version < 8) {
    // Load a polyfill for older versions of Node
  }

  if (host.os.windows) {
    // Windows-specific logic here
  }
}
```

Installation
--------------------------
Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/):

```bash
npm install host-environment
```



Usage
--------------------------
When using ES2015 syntax, you can simply `import` the `host` object:

```javascript
import host from "host-environment";
```

When using CommonJS syntax, we recommend that you `require()` the `host` object as a named export to ensure correct behavior with bundling tools like Webpack, Rollup, etc.

```javascript
const { host } = require("host-environment");
```



API
--------------------------

### `host.global`
When running in a web browser, `host.global` is a reference to the `window` object.  When running in Node.js, it's a reference to the `global` object.


### `host.os`
This property is an object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  windows: false,       // Windows or Windows Phone
  mac: true,            // Mac OS or iOS
  linux: false          // Linux, Android, or other *nix platforms
}
```

> **Note:** Only _one_ of the properties will be `true`. All others are `false`.


### `host.env`
This property is an object containing environment variables as key/value strings.  When running in Node.js, it is set to [`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env).

When running in a web browser, it is usually an empty object, since web browsers don't have access to environment variables. However, when paired with tools like [karma-host-environment](https://jsdevtools.org/karma-host-environment/), it's possible to work-around this limitation and allow you to access environment variables in the browser.

```javascript
{
  TERM: 'xterm-256color',
  SHELL: '/usr/local/bin/bash',
  USER: 'maciej',
  PATH: '~/.bin/:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin',
  PWD: '/Users/maciej',
  EDITOR: 'vim',
  SHLVL: '1',
  HOME: '/Users/maciej',
  LOGNAME: 'maciej',
  _: '/usr/local/bin/node'
}
```


### `host.node`
This property is `false` when running in a web browser.  When running in Node.js it is an object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  v7: true,             // The major version, as a boolean
  version: 7.3,         // The major.minor version, as a float
  majorVersion: 7,      // The major version, as an integer
  minorVersion: 3,      // The minor version, as an integer
  patchVersion: 24      // The patch version, as an integer
}
```


### `host.browser`
This property is `false` when running in Node.js. When running in a browser it is an object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  chrome: {             // false if not Chrome
    v58: true,          // The major version, as a boolean
    version: 58.4,      // The major.minor version, as a float
    majorVersion: 58,   // The major version, as an integer
    minorVersion: 4,    // The minor version, as an integer
    patchVersion: 3029, // The patch version, as an integer
    mobile: false,      // true on mobile
  },
  firefox: false,       // An object like above if running in Firefox
  safari: false,        // An object like above if running in Safari
  edge: false,          // An object like above if running in Edge
  IE: false,            // An object like above if running in Internet Explorer
  mobile: false,        // true for any mobile browser (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, etc)
}
```

> **Note:** Only _one_ of the browser properties will be an object. All others are `false`.
